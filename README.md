# HerSafety 💙  
**Your safety, first. Always.**

HerSafety is a mobile-first safety platform built to help women in India feel safer, act faster, and stay protected — whether you're walking home late or just need peace of mind in a sketchy situation.

This app isn’t just about reacting. It’s about *preventing* threats before they happen and *empowering* women to take control of their safety — all from their phone.

Now, someone does.
